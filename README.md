## "Features"

RUCS24-Bot has certain cogs that won't work and may throw errors
until the environment is properly configured for them to run. This
usually means including some information in the config file.

If you're having trouble and are confused, consider reading the comments
in the cog you want to enable until we find a better way to document
each one's usage instructions.

In order to enable a feature, simply include it in the "features" array 
in `config.json`. Here are the presently available features:

* "api": Connects to the Rutgers WebReg API to see if a course section is open
